Key Insights from the Dashboard
 Overall Sales Overview
  1.Total Sales: $1M
  2.Average Sales per Item: $141
  3.Total Items Sold: 9K
  4.Average Customer Rating: 4
 
Fat Content Impact
  1.Regular fat content contributes $776K to total sales, significantly more than low fat ($425K).
  2.Across outlet tiers, Tier 3 contributes the highest sales in both fat content categories.
 
Outlet Tier Sales
  1.Tier 3 outlets contribute the highest total sales ($472K), followed by Tier 2 ($393K) and Tier 1 ($336K).
  2.This suggests Tier 3 markets are more active or have better product penetration.

Sales Trend (Outlet Establishment Over Time)
  1.Sales peaked in 2019 at $205K, but have declined slightly since.
  2.There's a growth trend from 2010 to 2019, followed by slight fluctuation post-2020.

  2.Lower performing categories include Seafood ($9K) and Breads ($35K).
 
Outlet Size Analysis
  1.Medium-sized outlets generate the highest sales ($445K), followed by High ($249K) and Small ($50K).
  2.However, Medium outlets receive the most ratings (14K), suggesting higher customer engagement.

Ratings by Outlet Size
  1.Medium outlets have the highest ratings (14K), indicating better customer experiences.
  2.High outlets, despite higher capacity, receive fewer ratings (7K), possibly suggesting lower customer interaction or satisfaction.

Potential Actionable Recommendations
  1.Expand Tier 3 presence or invest more in those regions, as they generate the most revenue.
  2.Focus on Regular Fat items since they drive higher sales.
  3.Promote lower-performing item categories like Breads, Seafood, and Hard Drinks via offers or bundling.
  4.Investigate High outlet sizes – they generate fewer ratings, which could reflect lower customer satisfaction or traffic.
  5.Maintain and scale operations in Medium outlets, as they balance both high sales and customer satisfaction.
