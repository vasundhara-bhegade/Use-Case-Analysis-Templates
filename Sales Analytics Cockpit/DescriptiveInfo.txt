Business Question:
 How can we track and improve sales pipeline performance, monitor opportunity stages, and identify bottlenecks across quarters.

Objective:
 To create a unified view of the current and upcoming sales pipeline stages, opportunity health, and key performance metrics like win rate, 
 deal age, and forecast classification.

Expected Output:
 An interactive Power BI dashboard (Sales Cockpit) with visual KPIs on deal value, opportunity stage progression, pipeline health, win rate.
