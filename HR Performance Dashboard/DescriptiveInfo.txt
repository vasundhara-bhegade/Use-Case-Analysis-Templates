• Insights into employee satisfaction and role-specific attrition
• Key filters: department, job role, age group

Data Preparation Steps
• Cleaned missing values and ensured consistency
• Categorized salary into slabs
• Converted attrition values to numerical format for analysis
• Calculated attrition rate, average age, average tenure, and salary
